**NOTE: To be able to do this you may need to disable the System Integrity Protection (SIP). This can be done by booting into recovery mode (âŒ˜ + R on boot) and accessing the Terminal (Utilities > Terminal). To disable type the command `csrutil disable` followed by reboot to restart your machine.**
