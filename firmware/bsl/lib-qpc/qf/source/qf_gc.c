/**
* \description
* This function implements a simple garbage collector for the dynamic events.
* Only dynamic events are candidates for recycling. (A dynamic event is one
* that is allocated from an event pool, which is determined as non-zero
* e->poolId_ attribute.) Next, the function decrements the reference counter
* of the event (e->refCtr_), and recycles the event only if the counter drops
* to zero (meaning that no more references are outstanding for this event).
* The dynamic event is recycled by returning it to the pool from which
* it was originally allocated.
*
* \arguments
* \arg[in]  \c e  pointer to the event to recycle
*
* \note QF invokes the garbage collector at all appropriate contexts, when
* an event can become garbage (automatic garbage collection), so the
* application code should have no need to call QF_gc() directly. The QF_gc()
* function is exposed only for special cases when your application sends
* dynamic events to the "raw" thread-safe queues (see ::QEQueue). Such
* queues are processed outside of QF and the automatic garbage collection
* is CANNOT be performed for these events. In this case you need to call
* QF_gc() explicitly.
