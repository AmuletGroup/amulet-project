This directory contains a generic platform-independent QP/C port
to uC/OS-II.

Except small changes in qf_port.c, you should not need to change
the files in this directory to run QP-uC/OS port on any CPU/Compiler
to which uC/OS-II has been ported, because all the CPU and compiler
specifics are handled by the uC/OS-II RTOS.
