/*****************************************************************************
* NOTE1:
* QF_TX_PRIO_OFFSET specifies the number of highest-urgency ThreadX
* priorities not available to QP active objects. These highest-urgency
* priorities might be used by ThreadX threads that run "above" QP active
* objects.
*
* Because the ThreadX priority numbering is "upside down" compared
* to the QP priority numbering, the ThreadX priority for an active object
* thread is calculated as follows:
*     tx_prio = QF_TX_PRIO_OFFSET + QF_MAX_ACTIVE - qp_prio
*
* NOTE2:
* The maximum number of active objects in QP can be increased to 63,
* inclusive, but it can be reduced to save some memory. Also, the number of
* active objects cannot exceed the number of TreadX thread priorities
* TX_MAX_PRIORITIES, because each QP active object requires a unique
* priority level. Due to the artificial limitations of the ThreadX demo
* for Windows, QF_MAX_ACTIVE is set here lower to not exceed the total
* available priority levels.
*
* NOTE3:
* The ThreadX critical section must be able to nest, which is the case with
* the tx_interrupt_control() API.
