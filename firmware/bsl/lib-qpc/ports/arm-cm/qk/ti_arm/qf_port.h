/*****************************************************************************
* NOTE1:
* The maximum number of active objects QF_MAX_ACTIVE can be increased
* up to 63, if necessary. Here it is set to a lower level to save some RAM.
*
* NOTE2:
* On Cortex-M3/M4/M4F, the interrupt disable/enable policy uses the BASEPRI
* register (which is not implemented in Cortex-M0/M0+/M1) to disable
* interrupts only with priority lower than the level specified by the
* QF_BASEPRI macro. The interrupts with priorities above QF_BASEPRI (i.e.,
* with numerical priority values lower than QF_BASEPRI) are not disabled in
* this method. These free-running interrupts are not allowed to call any QF
* services, because QF is not aware of these interrupts. Coversely, only
* "QF-aware" interrupts, with numerical values of priorities eqal to or
* higher than QF_BASEPRI, can call QF services.
*
* NOTE3:
* For Cortex-M3/M4/M4F, the macro QF_BASEPRI leaves the top 2 priority bits
* empty for QF-aware interrupts. This is the highest-possible priority
* (lowest possible numerical value) for the guaranteed 3 priority bits
* implemented in the NVIC.
*
* NOTE4:
* The QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI macro is useful as an offset for enumerating
* the QF-aware interrupt priority levels in the applications, whereas the
* numerical values of the QF-aware interrupts must be greater or equal to
* QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI. The enumerated values based on
* QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI can be passed directly to the CMSIS function
* NVIC_SetPriority(), which shifts them by (8 - __NVIC_PRIO_BITS) into the
* correct bit position, while __NVIC_PRIO_BITS is the CMSIS macro defining
* the number of implemented priority bits in the NVIC. Please note that
* the macro QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI is intended only for applications and
* is not used inside the QF port, which remains generic and not dependent
* on the number of implemented priority bits in the NVIC.
*
* NOTE5:
* On Cortex-M0/M0+/M1 (architecture v6-M, v6S-M), the interrupt disabling
* policy uses the PRIMASK register to disable interrupts globally. The
* QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI level is zero, meaning that all interrupts are
* "kernel-aware".
