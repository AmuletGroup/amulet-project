/*****************************************************************************
* NOTE01:
* In Linux, the scheduler policy closest to real-time is the SCHED_FIFO
* policy, available only with superuser privileges. QF_run() attempts to set
* this policy as well as to maximize its priority, so that the ticking
* occurrs in the most timely manner (as close to an interrupt as possible).
* However, setting the SCHED_FIFO policy might fail, most probably due to
* insufficient privileges.
*
* NOTE02:
* On some Linux systems nanosleep() might actually not deliver the finest
* time granularity. For example, on some Linux implementations, nanosleep()
* could not block for shorter intervals than 20ms, while the underlying
* clock tick period was only 10ms. Sometimes, the select() system call can
* provide a finer granularity.
*
* NOTE03:
* Any blocking system call, such as nanosleep() or select() system call can
* be interrupted by a signal, such as ^C from the keyboard. In this case this
* QF port breaks out of the event-loop and returns to main() that exits and
* terminates all spawned p-threads.
*
* NOTE04:
* According to the man pages (for pthread_attr_setschedpolicy) the only value
* supported in the Linux p-threads implementation is PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM,
* meaning that the threads contend for CPU time with all processes running on
* the machine. In particular, thread priorities are interpreted relative to
* the priorities of all other processes on the machine.
*
* This is good, because it seems that if we set the priorities high enough,
* no other process (or thread running within) can gain control over the CPU.
*
* However, QF limits the number of priority levels to QF_MAX_ACTIVE.
* Assuming that a QF application will be real-time, this port reserves the
* three highest Linux priorities for the ISR-like threads (e.g., the ticker,
* I/O), and the rest highest-priorities for the active objects.
*
* NOTE05:
* The select() system call seems to deliver the finest time granularity of
* 1 clock tick. The timeout value passed to select() is rounded up to the
* nearest tick (10 ms on desktop Linux). The timeout cannot be too short,
* because the system might choose to busy-wait for very short timeouts.
* An alternative, POSIX nanosleep() system call seems to deliver only 20ms
* granularity.
*
* Here the select() call is used not just as a fairly portable way to sleep
* with subsecond precision. The select() call is also used to detect any
* characters typed on the console.
*
* Also according to man pages, on Linux, the function select() modifies
* timeout to reflect the amount of time not slept; most other implementations
* do not do this. This causes problems both when Linux code which reads
* timeout is ported to other operating systems, and when code is ported to
* Linux that reuses a struct timeval for multiple selects in a loop without
* reinitializing it. Here the microsecond part of the structure is re-
* initialized before each select() call.
