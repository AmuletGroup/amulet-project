**The Amulet Project** envisions computational jewelry, in the form of a bracelet or pendant, that provide the properties essential for successful body-area mHealth networks. These devices coordinate the activity of the body-area network and provide a discreet means for communicating with their wearer. Such devices complement the capabilities of a smartphone, bridging the gap between the type of pervasive computing possible with a mobile phone and that enabled by wearable computing. Find more information on the [Amulet Project Website](https://amulet-project.org/)


**The Amulet Platform** is a major step towards fulfilling this vision. The generalized platform is comprised of hardware and software for developing energy- and resource-efficient applications on multi-application wearable devices. This includes:

- the Amulet Firmware Toolchain
- the Amulet Runtime
- the ARP-View energy prediction and insight graphical tool ([check out a demo here](https://arpview.herokuapp.com))
- open reference hardware.

To get started, first clone this repository (including all submodules):

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AmuletGroup/amulet-project.git
```

### What is Amulet?

The Amulet platform is a collection of hardware, software, and tools, that enabled long-lived wearable research and development, in a variety of scientific domains. 

Amulet efficiently protects applications from each other without MMU support, allows developers to interactively explore how their implementation decisions impact battery life without the need for hardware modeling and additional software development
**Amulet represents a new approach to developing long-lived wearable applications.** We envision the Amulet Platform enabling long-duration experiments on human subjects in a wide variety of studies.

We also aim to equip the health-behavior science community with a wearable platform researchers can field for long-duration experiments on human subjects in a wide variety of studies, by providing the entire Amulet Platform as an open-source, open-hardware alternative to the available commercial platforms that have so far been used for wearables research. 
We envision the Amulet Platform as being broadly applicable to those in the sensing communities, as well as domain scientists and practitioners in human-centered fields like health and fitness. With the Amulet Platform, sensor researchers can prototype new wearable devices and test new sensing technology without building from scratch.
